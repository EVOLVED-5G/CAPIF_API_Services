    SupportedFeatures:
      description: A string used to indicate the features supported by an API that
        is used as defined in clause 6.6 in 3GPP TS 29.500. The string shall contain
        a bitmask indicating supported features in hexadecimal representation Each
        character in the string shall take a value of "0" to "9", "a" to "f" or "A"
        to "F" and shall represent the support of 4 features as described in table 5.2.2-3.
        The most significant character representing the highest-numbered features
        shall appear first in the string, and the character representing features
        1 to 4 shall appear last in the string. The list of features and their numbering
        (starting with 1) are defined separately for each API. If the string contains
        a lower number of characters than there are defined features for an API, all
        features that would be represented by characters that are not present in the
        string are not supported
